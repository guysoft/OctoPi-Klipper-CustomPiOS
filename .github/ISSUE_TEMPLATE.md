#### What were you doing?

<!-- 
Please be as specific as possible here. The maintainers will need to
reproduce your issue in order to fix it and that is not possible if they
don't know what you did to get it to happen in the first place.

Ideally provide exact steps to follow in order to reproduce your problem:
-->

1. ...
2. ...
3. ...

<!--
If you encountered a problem with specific files of any sorts, make sure
to also include a link to a file with which to reproduce the problem.
-->

#### What did you expect to happen?

#### What happened instead?

#### Did the same happen when running OctoPrint in safe mode?

<!-- 
Test if you can reproduce your problem in safe mode. You can find information
on how to enable safe mode in the Contribution Guidelines.

If you can't reproduce in safe mode, this is a bug with one of your
installed third party plugins. Don't open a ticket here!

If you can't test this in safe mode, state why.
